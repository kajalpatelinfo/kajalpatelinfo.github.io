Hi! I'm Kajal, a Stamps Scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Computer Science with minors in Statistics and Psychology. I design learning environments that respond to students' cognitive and emotional processes, rather than expecting them to adapt to system constraints.

My research examines how perceptual and affective processes influence decision-making and interpretation. Through computational modeling and behavioral analysis, I study both the conscious reasoning and automatic processes that shape how people engage with learning and intelligent systems. Whether examining how course structures affect student anxiety and engagement, or how multimodal models encode human perceptual biases, I seek to understand and improve the systems that mediate human experience.

My goal is to build computational models that capture individual differences in perception and social understanding, and to design adaptive systems that are sensitive to the ways people differ in how they communicate, respond, and collaborate.
