Hi! I'm Kajal, a fourth-year [Stamps Scholar](https://stamps.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Computer Science with minors in Statistics and Psychology. My research examines how perceptual and affective processes influence decision-making and interpretation, with specific emphasis on learning environments. Through computational modeling and behavioral analysis, I study both the conscious reasoning and automatic processes that shape how people engage with learning and intelligent systems. Whether examining how course structures affect student anxiety and engagement, or how multimodal models encode human perceptual biases, I seek to understand and improve the systems that mediate human experience. I am interested in building computational models that capture individual differences in perception and social understanding, and in designing adaptive systems that are sensitive to the ways people differ in how they communicate, respond, and collaborate.

I have been fortunate to be advised by many amazing mentors throughout my undergrad, including [Dr. Geoffrey Herman](https://publish.illinois.edu/glherman/), [Dr. Mariana Silva](https://mfsilva22.github.io/), [Dr. Ismini Lourentzou](https://isminoula.github.io/), and [Dr. Fethiye Irmak Doğan](https://www.irmakdogan.com/).
